# PhotoPass – Face and Voice Recognition System with Liveness Detection

## 🔍 Overview
This project integrates face verification, voice recognition, and liveness detection to enhance office security. It allows entry only when a real person is detected and verified by both face and voice recognition modules.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- SpeechRecognition, Librosa
- FaceNet, Siamese Networks
- CNN for liveness detection

## 🎯 Features
- Real-time facial recognition with liveness detection
- Voice matching for secondary verification
- End-to-end access control prototype

## 📂 Dataset Used
- LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) for face recognition
- VoxCeleb for speaker verification
- Custom real/live images and recorded voice samples

## 📈 Outcome
- Developed a secure office entry system using AI-based biometric authentication.
- Increased security by using multiple modalities.
